# Sort Algorithms Runtime in C

---

The main objective of this project is, through the most known sort algorithms in computer science, in order to compare the runtime of each one, understanding the differences among all them, and its best use on software engineering.

## ðŸš€ How to run

To run the program, is recommended to have in hands some C programming language IDE's, compile and execute ```programaPrincipal.cpp``` file.

> ðŸ’¡ You don't necessarily need to have an IDE installed on your computer to run this code. It's just need to have some C compiler (e.g. GCC) installed, and run it by command line.
